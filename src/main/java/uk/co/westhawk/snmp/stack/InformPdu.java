/**
 * This class represents the SNMP Inform Request Pdu. This request has
 * been added in SNMPv2c, hence is not supported by SNMPv1 agents.
 *
 * <p>
 * Inform Requests
 * are sent between managers. It is an acknowlegded trap since
 * the receiving end should send a Response Pdu as reply. 
 * The varbind list has the same elements as the TrapPduv2.<br/>
 * See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3416.txt">SNMPv2-PDU</a>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note this PDU should be sent to port 162 (the default trap port) by
 * default. You will have to create a SnmpContext with the 
 * ListeningContextFace.DEFAULT_TRAP_PORT as parameter!
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * For SNMPv3: The sender of an inform PDU acts as the authoritative engine.
 * </p>
 *
 * @see TrapPduv2
 * @see ListeningContextFace#DEFAULT_TRAP_PORT
 * @since 4_12
