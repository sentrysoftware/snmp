/**
 * This class represents the ASN SNMP v2c (and higher) Trap PDU object
 * that does not create a thread to send itself. It must be used with the
 * context class PassiveSnmpContextv2c. The original purpose of the
 * Passive classes is to allow the stack to be used in environments where
 * thread creation is unwanted, eg database JVMs such as Oracle JServer.
 * See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3416.txt">SNMPv2-PDU</a>.
